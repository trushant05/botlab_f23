# BotLab (Fall 2023)

This project was developed for the **ROB 550** course at the University of Michigan (Fall 2023). The focus of this lab is to build a full **autonomy stack** for a differential-drive robot using onboard sensors like LiDAR and odometry. The system includes modules for motion control, SLAM, path planning, and frontier-based exploration in a structured C++ framework.

## Code Structure

### 🔧 Core Components

- **[src](src)** – All source code organized by modules:
  - `mbot/`: Motion controller implementation for differential-drive and omnidirectional robots.
  - `slam/`: SLAM components including particle filter, scan matching, and occupancy grid mapping.
  - `planning/`: Path planning and exploration algorithms including A* and frontier-based exploration.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions for geometry, timing, and LCM support.

- **[include](include)** – Corresponding headers for all modules, separated by namespace.

- **[assets](assets)** – Contains visualizations and demo videos for checkpoint deliverables (e.g., `FastRun.mp4`, `map.png`).

- **[scripts](scripts)** – Installation and setup shell scripts.
  - `install.sh`: Installs dependencies and builds the workspace.

- **[services](services)** – Systemd service files for robot deployment:
  - `mbot-slam.service`, `mbot-motion-controller.service`

- **[build](build)** – Autogenerated folder by CMake after compilation (can be deleted and rebuilt).

- `CMakeLists.txt`: Project-level build file using CMake.

## ⚙️ How to Build

1. **Install LCM (Lightweight Communications and Marshalling)** if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install liblcm-dev
   ```

2. **Build the project using CMake:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j4
   ```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Launch SLAM
```bash
./build/mbot_slam
```

### Launch Motion Controller
```bash
./build/mbot_motion_controller
```

### Launch Exploration or Planning Server
```bash
./build/exploration
# or
./build/motion_planning_server
```

> You can also set these up as systemd services using files in the `services/` directory for auto-start on boot.
